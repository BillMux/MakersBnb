# MakersBnB

This is an AirBnB clone made by William, Muge, Ryan, Alfie

This app can allow the user to create accounts, log in and out. A user can list spaces and check lists of available spaces. They can use a js calendar to select available dates and thus book their trip. They have a list of upcoming trips on their profile as well as any spaces they have up for rental.
